rx-nostr is a library based on [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/), which allows [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) applications to easily communicate with relays.
It wraps REQ subscriptions and other primitive operations of Nostr application in the RxJS subscription model, and provides high-level interfaces.
It helps developers focus on the application logic, freeing them from tedious tasks such as relay pool management and WebSocket reconnection.
