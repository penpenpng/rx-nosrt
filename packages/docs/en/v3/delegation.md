# Delegation

rx-nostr supports event delegation based on [NIP-26](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/26.md).

## Publish Deleteged Events

You can use `delegateSigner()` to issue delegated events.

```ts
import { delegateSigner, nsecSigner } from "rx-nostr";

const signer = delegateSigner({
  delegateeSigner: seckeySigner(seckeyChild),
  delegatorSeckey: seckeyRoot,
  allowedKinds: [0, 1],
  allowedSince: 777777,
  allowedUntil: 888888,
});
```

The `allowed... ` field is used only to create a delegation string. That is, the signer with `delegateSigner()` can also generate events outside the delegation condition.

You can use `validateDelegation()` to validate the delegation condition.

## Subscribe Delegated Events

Enabling the `acceptDelegatedEvent` option allows you to subscribe to delegated events (if the relay supports queries based on NIP-26).

Regardless of the `acceptDelegatedEvent` setting, the `EventPacket` exposes a `rootPubkey` field. This field is equal to the public key of the delegator if the event is delegated, or the public key of the event's author if the event is not delegated.
